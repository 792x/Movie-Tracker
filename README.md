Movie Tracker was created for the people who like to keep track of the movies they have seen and the movies they still plan to watch. The web application lets users search for movies they are interested in. It includes title pages with all sorts of information on the movie. Users are able to add these movies to their own personal “plan to watch” or “watched” list when they are logged in. Users are be able to find these lists on your personal account page and, if the user is logged in, is able to sort the list, change the personal ratings, or mark them as ‘plan to watch’ or ‘watched’. When you are not logged in, the lists of users will still be accessible but without editing permissions.
